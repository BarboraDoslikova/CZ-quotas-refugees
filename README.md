# CZ-quotas-refugees

<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
Czech people are worried that Syrian refugees will flood their country, use social benefits to exploit the Czech social system and use religion to influence Czech culture beyond recognition (https://www.facebook.com/ivcrn).

The Czech Republic EU refugee quota is 1863 people (http://zpravy.aktualne.cz/zahranici/nova-zed-v-evrope-brusel-zverejnil-plan-kvot-na-uprchliky/r~204b65b4f94f11e490ae0025900fea04/).

Do concerns of the Czechs have merit?

<h2>METHODS</h2>
Use data from The Czech Statistical Office to find out the number of foreigners, particularly of non-European and of Syrian origin, living in the Czech Republic. 
Look at trends over the last 10 years.

<h2>FINDINGS</h2>
<h4>ALL</h4>
The total number of foreigners living in the Czech Republic has increased over the last 10 years but remained constant over the last 7 years i.e. since 2008.
The number of foreigners living in the Czech Republic originally from the EU has increased over the last 10 years.
The number of foreigners living in the Czech Republic originally from the non-EU states excluding Syria has increased between 2004 and 2008 but has gone down since 2008.
<h4>SYRIA</h4>
The number of foreigners living in the Czech Republic originally from Syria has increased over the last 10 years, particularly since 2012, corresponding with worsening of the situation in Syria.

<h2>CONCLUSIONS</h2>
Foreigners of Syrian origin currently living in the Czech Republic (in 2014) represent only 0.2% of all foreigners in the country. Adding people as required by the quota would increase the percentage to 0.6%.

Given these numbers, NO, it is unlikely that the extra people from Syria would flood the country and exploit and influence it as the Czech people worry
